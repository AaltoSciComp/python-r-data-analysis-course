    "Topics that we're going to cover on the R part of the course:\n",
    "- The modern Tinyverse approach to easy data analysis.\n",
    "- The tibble data structure, and how it relates to other common data structures.\n",

    "## R as a language\n",
    "\n",
    "R is nowadays one of the most popular data science languages. [1](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/) \n",
    "\n",
    "In Stack Overflow it is the 7th most popular language and neck to neck with C. [2](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to its older competitors like SPSS or SAS it is way more usable, but it is not as generic as e.g. Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "So use R for what it has been designed for - data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays there are three popular styles of doing data analysis in R:\n",
    "1. **Base R** - using objects (`vector`,`list`,`factor`,`data.frame`), functions (`apply`) and operators (`[ ]`,`[[ ]]`) of the base R packages\n",
    "2. **Tidyverse** - using objects (`tibble`), functions (`filter`,`select`,`mutate`,`map`) and operators (`%>%`) from [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) collection of packages.\n",
    "3. **data.table** - using objects (`data.table`), functions (`set`) and operators (`[Â ] `) of [data.table](http://r-datatable.com/) in conjunction with previous packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Base R can is (at least in my opinion) similar to Matlab/Fortran in its style. It is very permissive which enables very good solutions, but also very bad solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tidyverse is centered around the idea of certain base operations and code structures that are most frequent in data analysis. By making those structures easily readable and understandable it is easy to generate efficient code. We'll be doing this quite a bit here.\n",
    "\n",
    "data.table is an extension to base R's `data.frame`, but the syntax and underlying properties are written in a way that it can handle huge (up and beyond your RAM) datasets. We'll look a bit into it, but if you at some point need to work with big data, do remember that it exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "R has a wide variety of libraries supplied in the R-CRAN-network (Comprehensive R Archive Network). Installing these libraries is usually as simple as running:\n",
    "\n",
    "`install.package(\"packagename\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading these libraries is done with:\n",
    "\n",
    "`library(packagename)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will be using packages from R [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Imporant references\n",
    "\n",
    "There's lots of good R material available free on the internet. I highly recommend [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and [Efficient R programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/).\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to stuff related to the Tidyverse, the best options are googling or going to [its webpage](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and clicking on the honeycomb structure to get information on packages that supply the extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good keywords when searching information in the internet are:\n",
    "- \"tidyverse\" for tidyverse packages as a whole\n",
    "- \"dplyr\" for verbs that we'll be using\n",
    "- \"ggplot2\" for the versatile plotting library\n",
    "- \"tibble\" to get information on the `data.frame` extension\n",
    "- \"purrr\" for mapping functions that can be used to run functions on the data\n",
    "- \"tidyr\" for reshaping the data\n",
    "- \"readr\" for data reading functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually something like \"R *keyword i want to do this*\" gives a good answer from stackoverflow etc."
